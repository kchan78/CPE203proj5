I left nearestEntity() and findNearest() because

I left findOpenAround in Functions because it used the ORE_REACH data and didn't use instance variables from another class except for Point. 


Ambiguous methods-
I put moveEntity into WorldModel instead of Entity because it made more sense to me to move the entity within the world rather than entities moving themselves. Also, the if-statement checked conditional WorldModel method and called methods that were in WorldModel.

I moved executeQuakeActivity to Entity even though I was planning to leave it in Functions simply to follow the pattern of all other execute*Activity methods. Even though it didn't access entity data, I thought it would be better organized all together and to keep similar syntax.

I moved findOpenAround
